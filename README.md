# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
This is a challenge I did for my bootcamp. I was tasked to recreate my protfolio from the second challenge using bootstrap. In this project, I utilised bootstrap and the resources available on it to recreate, modify and improve on the portfolio I created last time.
